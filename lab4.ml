(*======================================================================
Part 1: Currying and uncurrying

Before getting into the main topic of this lab, how to handle
anomalous conditions using option types and exceptions, we continue
with some exercises about polymorphism.

........................................................................
Exercise 1: In this exercise, you'll define polymorphic higher-order
functions curry and uncurry for currying and uncurrying binary
functions (functions of two arguments). The functions are named after
mathematician Haskell Curry '1920. (By way of reminder, a curried
function takes its arguments one at a time. An uncurried function
takes them all at once in a tuple.)

To think about before you start coding:

  * What should the types of curry and uncurry be?

  * What is an example of a function that curry could apply to?
    Uncurry?

  * What are some tests that you could try to verify that your
    implementations of curry and uncurry work properly?

Now implement the two functions curry and uncurry.
......................................................................*)

let curry (f : 'a * 'b -> 'c) (x : 'a) (y : 'b) : 'c = 
  f(x, y) ;;
     
let uncurry (f : 'a -> 'b -> 'c) (x, y : 'a * 'b) : 'c = 
  f x y ;;

(*......................................................................
Exercise 2: OCaml's built in binary operators, like ( + ) and ( * ) are
curried:

# ( + ) ;;
- : int -> int -> int = <fun>
# ( * ) ;;
- : int -> int -> int = <fun>

Using your uncurry function, define uncurried versions of the plus and
times functions.
......................................................................*)

let plus =
  fun _ -> failwith "plus not implemented"
     
let times =
  fun _ -> failwith "times not implemented" ;;
  
(*......................................................................
Exercise 3: Recall the prods function from Lab 1:

let rec prods (lst : (int * int) list) : int list =
  match lst with
  | [] -> []
  | (x, y) :: tail -> (x * y) :: (prods tail) ;;

Now reimplement prods using map and your uncurried times function. Why
do you need the uncurried times function?
......................................................................*)

let prods =
  fun _ -> failwith "prods not implemented" ;; 

(*======================================================================
Part 2: Option types

In Lab 2, you implemented a function max_list that returns the maximum
element in a non-empty integer list. Here's a possible implementation
for max_list:

let rec max_list (lst : int list) : int =
  match lst with
  | [elt] -> elt
  | head :: tail -> max head (max_list tail) ;;

(This implementation makes use of the polymorphic max function from
the Pervasives module.)

As written, this function generates a warning that the match is not
exhaustive. Why? What's an example of the missing case? Try entering
the function in ocaml and see what information you can glean from the
warning message.

The problem is that there is no reasonable value for the maximum
element in an empty list. This is an ideal application for option
types.

........................................................................
Exercise 4: 

Reimplement max_list, but this time, it should return an int option
instead of an int. Call it max_list_opt. The None return value should
be used when called on an empty list.
......................................................................*)

let max_list_opt (lst : int list) : int option =
  failwith "max_list_opt not implemented" ;;

(*......................................................................
Exercise 5: Alternatively, we could have max_list raise an exception
upon discovering the error condition. Reimplement max_list so that it
does so. What exception should it raise? (See Section 10.2 in the
textbook for some advice.)
......................................................................*)

let max_list (lst : int list) : int =
  failwith "max_list not implemented" ;;
     
(*......................................................................
Exercise 6: Write a function min_option to return the smaller of two
int options, or None if both are None. If exactly one argument is
None, return the other. The built-in function min from the Pervasives
module may be useful. You'll want to make sure that all possible cases
are handled; no nonexhaustive match warnings!
......................................................................*)

let min_option (x : int option) (y : int option) : int option =
  failwith "min_option not implemented" ;;
     
(*......................................................................
Exercise 7: Write a function plus_option to return the sum of two int
options, or None if both are None. If exactly one argument is None,
return the other.
......................................................................*)

let plus_option (x : int option) (y : int option) : int option =
  failwith "plus_option not implemented" ;;

(*======================================================================
Part 3: Polymorphism practice

........................................................................
Exercise 8: Do you see a pattern in your implementations of min_option
and plus_option? How can we factor out similar code?

Write a polymorphic higher-order function calc_option to extend binary
operations to operate on option type values, taking three arguments in
order: the binary operation (a curried function) and its first and
second argument. If both arguments are None, return None.  If one
argument is (Some x) and the other argument is None, the function should
return (Some x). If neither argument is none, the binary operation
should be applied to the argument values and the result appropriately
returned.

What is calc_option's function type signature?

Now implement calc_option.
......................................................................*)

let calc_option =
  fun _ -> failwith "calc_option not implemented" ;;
     
(*......................................................................
Exercise 9: Now rewrite min_option and plus_option using the higher-order
function calc_option. Call them min_option_2 and plus_option_2.
......................................................................*)
  
let min_option_2 =
  fun _ -> failwith "min_option_2 not implemented" ;;
     
let plus_option_2 =
  fun _ -> failwith "plus_option_2 not implemented" ;;

(*......................................................................
Exercise 10: Now that we have calc_option, we can use it in other
ways. Because calc_option is polymorphic, it can work on things other
than int options. Define a function and_option to return the boolean
AND of two bool options, or None if both are None. If exactly one is
None, return the other.
......................................................................*)
  
let and_option =
  fun _ -> failwith "and_option not implemented" ;;
  
(*......................................................................
Exercise 11: In Lab 3, you implemented a polymorphic function zip that
takes two lists and "zips" them together into a list of pairs. Here's
a possible implementation of zip:

let rec zip (x : 'a list) (y : 'b list) : ('a * 'b) list =
  match x, y with
  | [], [] -> []
  | xhd :: xtl, yhd :: ytl -> (xhd, yhd) :: (zip xtl ytl) ;;

A problem with the implementation of zip is that, once again, its
match is not exhaustive and it raises an exception when given lists of
unequal length. How can you use option types to generate an alternate
solution without this property?

Do so below in a new definition of zip, called zip_opt to make clear
that its signature has changed, which returns an appropriate option
type in case it is called with lists of unequal length.
......................................................................*)

let zip_opt =
  fun _ -> failwith "zip not implemented" ;;

(*====================================================================
Part 4: Factoring out None-handling

Recall the definition of dotprod from Lab 2. Here it is adjusted to
an option type:

    let dotprod (a : int list) (b : int list) : int option =
      let pairsopt = zip_opt a b in
      match pairsopt with
      | None -> None
      | Some pairs -> Some (sum (prods pairs)) ;;

It uses zip_opt from Exercise 10 and prods from Exercise 3. The sum
function is simply *)
   
let sum : int list -> int =
  List.fold_left (+) 0 ;;

(* Notice how in dotprod and other option-manipulating functions we
frequently and annoyingly have to test if a value of option type is
None, requiring a separate match, and passing on the None value in the
"bad" branch or introducing the Some in the "good" branch. This is
something we're likely to be doing a lot of. Let's factor that out to
simplify the implementation.

........................................................................
Exercise 12: Define a function called maybe that takes a function of
type 'a -> 'b and an argument of type 'a option, and "maybe"
(depending on whether its argument is a None or a Some) applies the
function to the argument. The maybe function either passes on the None
if its first argument is None, or if its first argument is Some v, it
applies its second argument to that v and returns the result,
appropriately adjusted for the result type.

What should the type of the maybe function be?

Now implement the maybe function.
......................................................................*)
  
let maybe (f : 'a -> 'b) (x : 'a option) : 'b option =
  failwith "maybe not implemented" ;; 

(*......................................................................
Exercise 13: Now reimplement dotprod to use the maybe function. (The
previous implementation makes use of functions sum and prods. You've
already (re)implemented prods in Exercise 3. We've provided sum for
you above.)  Your new solution for dotprod should be much simpler than
the version we provided above at the top of Part 4.
......................................................................*)

let dotprod (a : int list) (b : int list) : int option =
  failwith "dotprod not implemented" ;; 

(*......................................................................
Exercise 14: Reimplement zip_opt along the same lines, in zip_opt_2
below.
......................................................................*)

let rec zip_opt_2 (x : 'a list) (y : 'b list) : (('a * 'b) list) option =
  failwith "zip_opt_2 not implemented" ;;

(*......................................................................
Exercise 15: For the energetic, reimplement max_list_opt along the
same lines. There's likely to be a subtle issue here, since the maybe
function always passes along the None.
......................................................................*)

let rec max_list_opt_2 (lst : int list) : int option =
  failwith "max_list not implemented" ;;
